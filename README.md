## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

Still getting comfortable with media queries and perfecting it. Also some of the colors and fonts aren't perfect but their close enough.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - this may as well be your home page
- [CSS-Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) - I love this website and you should use it. It really helped me out with understanding flexbox and media queries.
